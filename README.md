## Introduction

<p align="justify">Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a wide range of cloud computing services and solutions. This repository serves as a collection of AWS projects demonstrating different infrastructure setups, configurations, and best practices using tools like AWS Management console, AWS CLI, Terraform, Git, and GitHub.</p>

## Projects

### 1. [AWS 3-Tier Architecture](https://github.com/DDMateus/AWS-Projects/tree/273e6eb99c64c52d59ab93c0da86c79c90cc58ea/AWS%203-Tier%20Architecture)

This project provides step-by-step instructions for deploying a 3-tier architecture on AWS. The architecture organizes applications into three logical and physical computing tiers.

### 2. [AWS IAM](https://github.com/DDMateus/AWS-Projects/tree/273e6eb99c64c52d59ab93c0da86c79c90cc58ea/AWS%20IAM)

This project focuses on Identity and Access Management (IAM) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and provides instructions on launching EC2 instances with tags, creating IAM policies, testing resource access, and cleaning up resources.

### 3. [AWS Web Server](https://github.com/DDMateus/AWS-Projects/tree/273e6eb99c64c52d59ab93c0da86c79c90cc58ea/AWS%20Web%20Server)

This project demonstrates the deployment of a simple web server on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using an EC2 Linux instance.

### 4. [Amazon-Virtual-Private-Cloud-VPC](https://github.com/DDMateus/AWS-Projects/tree/273e6eb99c64c52d59ab93c0da86c79c90cc58ea/Amazon-Virtual-Private-Cloud-VPC)

This project demonstrates the creation and configuration of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on Amazon Web Services (AWS). A VPC is a virtual network that allows you to launch AWS resources in a defined virtual network environment. This project provides instructions on how to set up and configure a VPC along with additional subnets, routing tables, security groups, and cleanup procedures.

### 5. [CloudFormation](https://github.com/DDMateus/AWS-Projects/tree/273e6eb99c64c52d59ab93c0da86c79c90cc58ea/CloudFormation)

AWS CloudFormation is a powerful service that simplifies the management of AWS resources by allowing you to define your infrastructure as code. With CloudFormation, you can create templates that describe all the resources you need, such as EC2 instances, RDS database instances, and more. In this project we will use CloudFormation to build a VPC with one Amazon EC2 instance (webserver).

### 6. [Deploying a WordPress Website on AWS](https://github.com/DDMateus/AWS-Projects/tree/273e6eb99c64c52d59ab93c0da86c79c90cc58ea/Deploying%20a%20WordPress%20Website%20on%20AWS)

In this project, we will walk through the process of deploying a WordPress website on AWS using a 3-tier architecture.

### 7. [Host Static Website on AWS](https://github.com/DDMateus/AWS-Projects/tree/273e6eb99c64c52d59ab93c0da86c79c90cc58ea/Host%20Static%20Website%20on%20AWS)

This project demonstrates the deployment of a static HTML web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The project utilizes various AWS resources and services to host the web app securely and efficiently.

### 8. [VPC Peering](https://github.com/DDMateus/AWS-Projects/tree/273e6eb99c64c52d59ab93c0da86c79c90cc58ea/VPC%20Peering)

A VPC peering connection establishes a private network connection between two VPCs, allowing secure communication between them. In this guide, we'll peer VPC A with VPC B and VPC A with VPC C using CloudFormation templates.
